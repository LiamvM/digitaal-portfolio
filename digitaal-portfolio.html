		<h1>About me,</h1>
		<p> My name is Liam, I'm currently a student learning and working to become a programmer.</p>
		<p>
		I've never really learned or knew what programming was and what you could do with it, untill i did a try-out on the school i am now, and still on today discovering that programming really is a part which missed in my life.
		And i really enjoy it uptill today.
		</p>
		<p>I'm always trying my best to discover new ways of how to improve my own website, currently it's not always working out to my own desire. But i will learn that in the future of course of how to do it the right and correct way.</p>
